title: Vets.gov Design System
---

Currently, this is USWDS' Fractal system with an overlay of Vets. It's very much a WIP. 

## To Do:

- Remove components we're not using on Vets
- Incorporate documentation for Foundation grid
- Match font styles
- Match color palette (largely the same?)
- Add components that we _are_ using on Vets that are not on USWDS (what are these?)
