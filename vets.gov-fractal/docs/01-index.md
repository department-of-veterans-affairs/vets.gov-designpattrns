title: Vets.gov Design System
---

Currently, this is USWDS' Fractal system with an overlay of Vets. It's very much a WIP. 

## To Do:

- Get the CSS working properly
- Remove components we're not using on Vets
  - labels
  - forms > password reset form
  - forms > sign in form (this and above handled by id.me)
  - US Government banner (replace with WIP banner)
  - Graphic list
  - Hero
  - Buttons > Primary Alt (replace with green)
  - Buttons > Secondary (replace with outline)
  - Buttons > Grey
  - Buttons > Outline Inverse

- Incorporate documentation for Foundation grid
- Match font styles
- Match color palette (largely the same?)
- Add components that we _are_ using on Vets that are not on USWDS (what are these?)
