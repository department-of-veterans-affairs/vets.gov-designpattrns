The Fractal branch of https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-designpattrns contains two new directories:

* vets.gov-fractal
* vets.gov-patternlab

It's an exploration of Fractal and Pattern Lab as tools for a design system for Vets.gov going forward. The idea is that the design system would serve as the single source of truth for front-end developers looking for code, and for designers and content team looking for context around when to use a particular UI pattern, and how.

To see either or both of these, clone the Fractal branch of this repo, `cd` into the appropriate directory, and then follow directions for getting started:

[Fractal](http://fractal.build/guide/installation)
[Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/docs/requirements.html#node)

You can run both simultaneously. Please be advised -- these are v. incomplete proofs of concept. Ping @phiden if you want the rundown.

Vets.gov has an existing Pattern Lab instance, which is six months out of date but lives [here](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/vets.gov-designpattrns/)
