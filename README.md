- `molecules`: groups of elements, i.e. input form,
- `organisms`: groups of components forming a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface, i.e. a Nav section
- `templates`: pages formed by putting together blocks

#### Developing locally
Run `grunt patternlab:serve` from the root of this repo
